== Contributing

If you landed here, you likely want to contribute the project. Let me thank you already.
There are several ways you can help. Please start with the few notes below.


=== Features and issues

Whether you are reporting an issue you ran into or requesting a new feature, please https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli/issues/new[open an issue here].

You know the drill: please try to provide some context information, the version you used, your OS, how to reproduce. That will greatly help solving your issue quicker.


=== Documentation

The documentation of this project is mainly done using https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. Unfortunately, it takes https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095[litterally ages] for Github to support THE feature that makes AsciiDoc shine.
As a result, for now, this project is generating the markdwown from AsciiDoc. In short that means that you should NOT modify any `.md` file but change the `.adoc` ones and run `just md` to generate all the markdown.


=== Tooling

This project is mainly using Rust so you will need to install the Rust compiler. Make sure everything works with the latest **stable** version of Rust.

You will find a `justfile` in the root of the repo. This is to be used with https://github.com/casey/just[just] so you may want to install that as well. Just type `just` üòÅ to discover how it can help you.

Before submitting your code, do a `cargo clippy` stop to make sure everything works fine. Don't forget to `cargo fmt --all` as well if you want to be friend with the CI. No surprise, the test can be ran using `cargo test`.

You may activate the **logs** for the project using `RUST_LOG=debug` for instance.

=== Pull Requests

PRs are welcome. Feel free to open them early before putting too much effort (you may start with a draft). This way you can ping me (https://github.com/chevdor[@chevdor]) if you want my opinion on what and how you are putting your change together.
